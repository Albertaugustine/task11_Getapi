Take data from database and view the response using GET method using RESTer.
In add_data.php the data from the "user" table in my database is fetched to a variable and we use json encode function.

Then the path to the getdata.php file in localhost is copied to RESTer
And also the index.html page will display the entire table.

*Accesing RESTer:
RESTer is available as an extension in the browser. Just search and download it for the speific browser.
